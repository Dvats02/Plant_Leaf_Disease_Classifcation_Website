# üå± Plant Leaf Disease Classification (32 Classes)

This project is a **Deep Learning-based application** that classifies plant leaf diseases into **32 different categories** using images.  
The system helps farmers and agricultural experts detect plant diseases early, improving crop yield and reducing losses.

## üìå Features
- **Supports 32 plant disease classes**
- **Image-based classification** using a trained CNN model
- **User-friendly UI** for uploading leaf images
- **Real-time predictions** with confidence scores
- Model trained on a large dataset of labeled plant leaf images
