## üå± Project Overview

Leaves from different plants exhibit unique symptoms when affected by diseases. This project leverages deep learning to detect and classify a wide range of plant diseases using image classification. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on leaf images of various crops, enabling multi-crop support and robust disease recognition.

## ü¶† Supported Diseases

The model supports classification for the following diseases across various plant species:

- Apple_scab  
- Black_rot  
- Cedar_apple_rust  
- Powdery_mildew  
- Cercospora_leaf_spot / Gray_leaf_spot  
- Common_rust  
- Northern_Leaf_Blight  
- Esca (Black_Measles)  
- Leaf_blight (Isariopsis_Leaf_Spot)  
- Haunglongbing (Citrus Greening)  
- Bacterial_spot  
- Early_blight  
- Late_blight  
- Leaf_scorch  
- Leaf_Mold  
- Septoria_leaf_spot  
- Spider_mites / Two-spotted_spider_mite  
- Target_Spot  
- Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus  
- Tomato_mosaic_virus  

Some diseases are crop-specific, and class names may include both plant and disease for clarity.
